# Sentiment–Price Dynamics in Bitcoin: A LPPLS and Wavelet Coherence Analysis of Bubbles

Our study examines the Bitcoin bubbles from August 2018 through September 2025, starting by applying the \emph{Johansen–Ledoit–Sornette}  framework to identify their beginning and peak dates, and after using \emph{Wavelet Coherence Analysis} to characterize the relationship between the Bitcoin price and the \emph{Fear and Greed Index} in correspondence to the identified bubbles.

This repository contains materials from our study. It includes:
- Two datasets.
- A Python notebook for detailed analysis of the collected data, divided into steps.
