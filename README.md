# Sentiment–Price Dynamics in Bitcoin: A LPPLS and Wavelet Coherence Analysis of Bubbles

Our study examines the Bitcoin bubbles from August 2018 through September 2025, starting by applying the \emph{Johansen–Ledoit–Sornette}  framework to identify their beginning and peak dates, and after using \emph{Wavelet Coherence Analysis} to characterize the relationship between the Bitcoin price and the \emph{Fear and Greed Index} in correspondence to the identified bubbles.

This repository contains materials from our study. It includes:
- Two datasets.
- A Python notebook for detailed analysis of the collected data, divided into steps.

## Contents

- `BTC_data2012.csv`: comprising Bitcoin prices, from January 2012 to September 2025.
- `fng_dataX`:  with Fear and Greed Index, from February 2018 to September 2025.
- `BTC_Bubbles.iynb`: Python notebook for data analysis.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Bitcoin-Bubbles.git
2. Ensure all files are in the same directory.
3. Open the Python notebook (BTC_Bubbles.iynb) using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab to explore the analysis.
4. The notebook uses two datasets as input for statistical analysis and insights generation related to the relationship between Bitcoin price and the Fear and Greed Index during bubbles.
